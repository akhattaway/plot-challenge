# Description:
This UT Module 5 plot-challenge is an analysis on efficacy of Capomulin on the reduction of tumor volume compared to other leading treatments. The cohort consisted of 249 mice subjects, the completed study results use 248 subjects due to duplicate data on subject g989.

# Analysis

In this study it is evident that Capomulin and Ramicane tend to result in lower overall tumor volumes and exhibit lower standard deviations. However, a deeper examination into the characteristics of the mice is warranted. For example, we should explore whether the mice receiving these treatments had lower initial weights compared to those in other treatment groups and evaluate their starting tumor volumes. Additionally, examining the changes in tumor volume between different timepoints might provide valuable insights for comparing the effectiveness of different drugs.

The study reveals there is a strong correlation between weight and tumor volume. However, it's important to consider further investigation with a controlled study that involves subjects with similar weights. This would help us better comprehend the specific impact of the drug.

While the study's findings indicate leading indicators that Capomulin leads to a lower tumor volume on average with more consistent results, we should exercise caution as the results are not definitive. Further research is needed to establish Capomulin's efficacy in reducing tumor volume consistently and to a greater extent compared to other treatments.
